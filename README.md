# BookMaker

The "BookMaker" is a Java program that allows you to easily write Minecraft written book!

In Minecraft 1.8 new book mechanic were introduced, allowing players to customize their books with multiple styles. But writing JSON is not always simple, specially for books.
The goal of this tool is to let you decide the final result you want to obtain without worring about the JSON part.

The output of this program will be a command like "give @p written_book{pages:['["", ... ]']}". You can save this command in a file or copy it to clipboard and easily paste it inside a command block
